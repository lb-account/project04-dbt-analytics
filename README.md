# Google Analytics E-commerce Analysis with DBT and BigQuery

## 📌 Overview  
This project demonstrates how to use **DBT** (Data Build Tool) in conjunction with **BigQuery** to collect, transform, and analyze data from a public Google Analytics e-commerce dataset. The goal is to showcase data transformation and analysis skills while applying best practices such as adding tests and documentation to ensure data integrity and maintainability.

The project covers the entire workflow, from extracting raw data to transforming it into actionable insights, ensuring high data quality with testing, and documenting the steps for reproducibility and clarity.

- **dbt_project.yml** – The main DBT project configuration file  
- **models/** – Contains DBT models for data transformation and analysis  
    - **bronze/** – Raw data transformation from source systems, focused on basic cleaning and initial ingestion  
    - **silver/** – Further cleaning, enrichment, and data quality improvements to create a more usable dataset  
    - **gold/** – Final, transformed, and highly-aggregated tables ready for analysis and reporting  
- **tests/** – DBT tests to ensure data quality and consistency 
- **documentation/** – Documentation of the project and data pipeline steps  

## 🛠️ Installation and Setup  

To run this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository and install dependencies.
2. Set up **BigQuery** credentials and connection.
3. Set up your DBT environment with `dbt-core` and `dbt-bigquery`:
